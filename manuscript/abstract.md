# Abstract

If you are in any way affiliated with network and virtual infrastructure troubleshooting and monitoring, you're going to like this book. If you're driven crazy by having to overlap multiple tools to get the information needed to troubleshoot an issue in your environment, you're going to love this book.

As the title suggests, this book will give you a deep dive look at VMware's holistic networking and virtual infrastructure monitoring & troubleshooting product; vRealize Network Insight.

vRealize Network Insight is famous for a couple reasons:

1. It has the capability to kickstart your way to a secure segmented network by creating visibility into what actually happens on your network.

2. It sucks up all the operational and configuration data of your virtual (vSphere, Kubernetes, Bare metal), public cloud (AWS & Azure), SD-WAN, and physical network environment and allows you to overlay the two to create a holistic view of your entire environment and use that to significantly reduce time spent troubleshooting and gathering data from your environment.

3. Analytics that go over all the data that's pulled into Network Insight, provide a great deal of useful information; from "who is using my applications?", to "are there any abnormalities in the network behavior?", to all the way to "how much is this cloud egress bandwidth costing me?".

You will be guided through the components and architecture of Network Insight and discover hidden gems and secrets throughout the platform. This book will take you from beginner to a vRealize Network Insight Samurai and we'll have some fun along the way!
