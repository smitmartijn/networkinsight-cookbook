**Abstract**

If you are in any way affiliated with network and virtual infrastructure troubleshooting and monitoring, you're going to like this book. If you're driven crazy by having to overlap multiple tools to get the information needed to troubleshoot an issue in your environment, you're going to love this book.

As the title suggests, this book will give you a deep dive look at VMware's holistic networking and virtual infrastructure monitoring & troubleshooting product; vRealize Network Insight.

Network Insight is famous for a couple reasons:

1.  It has the capability to kickstart your way to a secure segmented network by creating visibility into what actually happens on your network.

2.  It sucks up all the operational and configuration data of your virtual (vSphere, Kubernetes, Bare metal), public cloud (AWS & Azure), SD-WAN, and physical network environment and allows you to overlay the two to create a holistic view of your entire environment and use that to significantly reduce time spent troubleshooting and gathering data from your environment.

3.  Analytics that go over all the data that's pulled into Network Insight, provide a great deal of useful information; from "who is using my applications?", to "are there any abnormalities in the network behavior?", to all the way to "how much is this cloud egress bandwidth costing me?".

You will be guided through the components and architecture of Network Insight and discover hidden gems and secrets throughout the platform. This book will take you from beginner to a vRealize Network Insight Samurai and we'll have some fun along the way!



Introduction -- About the author
================================

As I'm sitting in the airport, waiting for my flight after a team building exercise with the Networking & Security Business Unit within VMware, the thought going through my head is: why? Why on earth are you starting another big project that's going to take up a ton of time? The reason is simple: Hi, I'm Martijn Smit and I'm an information sharing addict (echo's: "hi Martijn!").

I'm proud to be Dutch and proud to be in the industry I'm in. My career started at a hosting company, in which I spent 8 years moving from the webhosting help desk to colocation & dedicated server support, to managing the internet-network and helping to build a new datacenter from the ground up. After leaving this provider, I joined a value-added reseller company, with which I spent 5 years designing and deploying data center infrastructures, including storage, compute, networking and virtualization. I was also in the innovation group that brought the last two together to support virtual networking; Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

I currently work at VMware in Technical Marketing for vRealize Network Insight, as I fully believe in the way Network Insight is approaching Networking & Security troubleshooting and monitoring and want to spread the word. My previous role was to guide customers to the world of virtual networking; NSBU Solutions Engineer. Having said that; don't worry, this book is not going to be a sales pitch but hardcore technical information (just as I like it. ;-)).

Apart from my passion for technology, I believe in a healthy balance and taking care of yourself, so often take 2 to 3-hour bike rides, exercise every day and eat proper food. One of my favorite hobbies is spending time on doing elaborate meals using my Kamado Egg barbecue. I also tear through books and have a goal to read at least 30 books yearly. As mentioned before, I'm an information sharing addict and mostly do so by giving talks and doing technical blogs.

If you would like to see more of my rants, you can follow me on twitter on [\@smitmartijn](https://twitter.com/smitmartijn) or on my blog at <https://lostdomain.org>

Back to this book; so, I have been dealing with the entire data center stack for years. One of the things that always annoyed me was that there was no good solution to troubleshoot and monitor that entire stack; it was always separate solutions for each layer. In 2014, I came across a company called ArkinNet, which had an amazing product which could collect data from multiple layers (storage, compute and networking) and present this data in a holistic way. After doing some due diligence, I immediately started talks to include Arkin into our product portfolio and I've been in love with the product ever since.

Arkin was later acquired in June of 2016 by VMware and it is now known as vRealize Network Insight.

Let's dive in!

P.S: I've written this book on personal title, not as a VMware employee. Any opinions in here are my own and not per se the opinion of VMware.

Foreword by Shiv Agarwal
========================

*Founder of ArkinNet, currently Vice-President of Network Insight with VMware*

VMware vRealize Network Insight (or vRNI, or Network Insight) has seen a massive adoption in VMware customer base helping our customers get end-to-end visibility and operational simplicity as they embrace a software defined approach to networking and security. Network Insight completes VMware's Virtual Cloud Network vision and story by providing seamlessly visibility and converged network operations across the data center (virtual and physical) and hybrid cloud as well as branch offices and remote sites (via SD-WAN integration).

Jogging down the memory lane, Network Insight came into VMware through the Arkin (ArkinNet) acquisition. As it happens so often in Silicon Valley, my co-founder and I were at VMware before we went out and started Arkin (in 2013). We had joined VMware (in 2008) as part of the Blue Lane acquisition. At Blue Lane, we had built a virtual firewall which became the first-generation virtual firewall (VMware NSX DFW) inside VMware. During our first tenure at VMware (2008-2013), NSX was in its infancy. We saw enterprise customers struggling to operate their virtual networking stack. They were trying to use their existing legacy processes and toolset. Their people's mindset was geared and tuned to managing physical networks. Virtualization was new to the network operators. That's when my cofounder and I got the idea of starting Arkin. You start a company with a big vision, ours was to transform how networks are operated. Idea was to bring consumer grade simplicity to managing networks. We wanted to challenge the status quo. Our first set of use cases was to help customers implement micro-segmentation and operationalize NSX. NSX was becoming the dominant network virtualization stack and we betted on it. We got the first product out in 18 months with some of the marquee NSX customers using it in production and were acquired by VMware in 36 months. At VMware, it was like a match made in heaven. Thanks to the NSX sales team, the two products together (NSX and Network Insight) started flying off the shelf! It's been fun! I tell my team often that the acquisition by VMware was a mere pit stop in our journey, which, at the time of writing this foreword, is still continuing.

We continue to build. Network Insights expanded charter and scope now includes end-to-end network operations - monitoring, troubleshooting and optimization. By combining the different types of network data (flows, packets, metrics, config, streaming, etc.), we have provided a unique platform for our customers to converge their traditionally silo-ed visibility and realize a multitude of use cases around next generation networking and security. We have also created a unique advantage for ourselves by adding a strong application context to network and security dataset. Applications are the lifeline of an enterprise and Network Insight's powerful application discovery and planning feature enables our customers to see their network and security data through the lens of their applications. We are thus elevating IT and empowering them to have a more business-oriented conversation with their line of businesses.

Over the next few years, we see the operational silos breaking at a rapid pace and a lot of automation happening, ultimately leading to self-driving networks. That's the future. Silos create inefficiency and finger pointing. Our vision is to bring a high degree of efficiency in network operations through convergence, consumer grade experience and analytical insights. We continue to deliver upon our vision by investing in new areas. Recently, we acquired a company, Veriflow, which has pioneered the area of network verification in software. This technique is used in many mission critical industries where failure can be catastrophic such as airlines and space. Networking is mission critical for our customers. With this acquisition, we will be arming our customers with network modeling and prediction and significantly push the frontier of network operations in the enterprises.

I am very happy and excited to be writing this foreword for Martijns book on VMware vRealize Network Insight. Martijn has been the technical face and flag bearer of Network Insight in the EMEA region for a long time. I hope the insights captured in his book will trigger in the mind of its readers a genuine thought about transforming their network and security operations.

Pre-face
========

This book is for people in jobs or interests related to networking and security in private, hybrid and/or public clouds. Managing these networks and security policies becomes a much easier job with Network Insight and this book will try to explain best how to go about managing those networks and how Network Insight itself is positioned to do so.

Sometimes it's not all in the name. This is also true for Network Insight, as it gives you not just insight into your network, but your compute, storage and network layers.

With Network Insight, you can take the guesswork out of deploying micro-segmentation with comprehensive network flow analytics to map out real-time traffic and model security groups and firewall rules to successfully implement micro-segmentation security policies. It also helps to improve performance and availability of the infrastructure by combining and correlating virtual and physical compute, storage and networking components to provide a clear and full picture of the infrastructure.

It does not discriminate between virtual machines or physical servers, provides detailed information about the smallest workloads (containers), has integrations with the VMware Virtual Cloud Network vision and everything that runs beneath the Virtual Cloud Network.

Network Insight collects data from data sources like VMware vSphere, VMware NSX, Physical network devices (switches, routers, load balancers, and firewalls), Physical converged systems, IPAM systems and log collectors. All this information is put in a structured database, correlated and available via the intuitive user interface and API. The way this converged information is disclosed with the user interface is what makes Network Insight unique and such a pleasure to work with.

It\'s all about the fundamentals of the platform, as it's designed from the ground up to be as open as possible. This means you can retrieve any and all the data that is gathered and do all kinds of neat things with it like filtering, grouping, sorting and perform other modifiers on it (more on that in the chapter []{.underline}

[\
Using the Search Engine]{.underline}).

Apart from configuration and operational data, you can also send real-time network flow (NetFlow or sFlow) data to Network Insight to map out which workloads in your environment talk to each other. Because all data is correlated, the network flow data is linked to the source or destination workload (virtual machine or physical host) and you can see the name of the workload related to the flow, instead of just seeing that **10.0.0.10** talks to **10.0.1.11** over port **80**.

  ------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INFO   **Configuration data** is meant as the configuration of the data source (i.e. show running-configuration on a physical Cisco device and the inventory of a VMware vCenter, etc.). **Operational data** is meant as dynamic, changing data on data sources (i.e. the route and mac tables on a network device, IP addresses of virtual machines, etc.).
  ------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This network flow data is typically generated by the vSphere Distributed Switch or a physical network device.

Due to the technical and sometimes very specific nature of this book, it's advised to have a Network Insight instance ready to go while you are reading; so, you can try things out with data from your own infrastructure!

The content of this book is based on Network Insight 5.0 (with some small nuggets on 5.1, because I took too long to write it). Considering the product team is an innovation engine and moves really quickly (delivers major features every 3 months), you need to doublecheck the details when you're using a newer version. This book also does not intend to replace the [official documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Network-Insight/index.html), but rather complement it. The specific technical details in this book will age, and rightly so.







Using the Search Engine
=======================

**This chapter was authored by Rohit Reja, Senior Staff Engineer on Network Insight. He was part of the original ArkinNet team.\

Edited by: Martijn Smit

vRealize Network Insight provides a datacenter semantics aware search engine to quickly find objects of interest based on their configuration. This search engine is built on top of a highly scalable Elastic Search cluster, and it can provide rich insights into complex virtual and physical data center compute and network fabric.

The search engine is powered by an Elastic Search cluster, which is the first service that gets addressed when a search is requested. Elastic Search can point to other databases from where Network Insight will pull data. For example, index pointers for metric refer to the HBASE database, while configuration items (like VM properties) get referred to PostgreSQL. Indexing happens on a continuous basis; each time an object is updated in any database, Elastic Search will update its index.

It is possible for this index process to lag a few seconds, causing old data to still show up or new data to not show up yet. That's why you can monitor the indexer lag from the **Install and Support** page in the **Settings**.

The syntax is technical natural language, and the search bar helps by doing autocomplete on keywords and values (i.e. VM names). You can simply start typing what you need into the search bar and chances are, you will find the search query you need. Think of it as a Google for your data center.

Configuration objects, metrics, pinboards, static pages, and flows can all be searched for. Configuration objects are single values that typically don't change every second (e.g. *CPU Count*, *Host*, *VM*, *Distributed Virtual Portgroup*, etc.). Metrics have multiple values on a timeline and tend to change a lot (e.g. *CPU Usage*, *Network Rate*, *Write Latency*, etc.). The ability to search for pinboards and static pages (such as the Security Planner page), makes it so that you can navigate entirely by using the search bar, just like on a command line interface.

The technical natural language that is being used, is almost exactly like database query syntax. If you have a data base administrator (DBA) background (or DBA colleague sitting next to you), the syntax will be even more intuitive.

Let's look at some examples:

Find all virtual machines with 4 vCPUs.

vm where cpu count = 4

Display a sum of traffic flow for all servers (virtual and physical) in VLAN 2003

sum(bytes) of flows where source l2 network = vlan-2003

Find all virtual machines to whom VMs in VXLAN 5001 are talking to.

list(dst vm) of flows where src l2 network = vxlan-5001

Find all applications that are talking to the application 3TierApp02 and display how much traffic is being sent.

sum(bytes) of flow where Destination Application = \'3TierApp02\' group by Source Application

[]{#_Toc35170230 .anchor}Figure 72 -- Search query & results example

The cool part about the search engine is, is that all results and searches are reusable. You can create pinboards from different searches, personalizing these pinboards completely. You can also create search-based events and get alerts whenever the result of a search changes (get notified whenever firewall rule changes happen) or when there are no results (get notified when something is deleted).

Search is also exposed via the public APIs for automation, making it possible to programmatically execute searches and get back the results for further processing. Considering all data inside Network Insight is available via the search, this means that you can export and process any and all information for your own purposes. Organizations have built automation processes around Network Insight to import data into Security Event & Information Management (SIEM) systems, Security Operation Centers (SOC) get notified on any firewall rule changes and verify them against the change management trackers, service providers pull network bandwidth calculations to use for billing purposes, the list goes on. More information on how to automate with Network Insight and examples in the chapter [Automating Network Insight.]{.underline}

Building Searches
-----------------

vRealize Network Insight provides a structured query with components illustrated in below diagram. I'll explain the different components in this chapter.

![](./media/image77.jpeg){width="5.3086395450568675in" height="0.7407403762029746in"}

[]{#_Toc35170231 .anchor}Figure 73 -- Search query structure

Consider the following query:

VMs where ip address = '10.10.10.0/24\` order by vCPUs

Let's break it down and align it with the query structure.

-   *"VMs"* is the entity type,

-   *"where ip address = 10.10.10.0/24"* is the filter clause,

-   *"order by vCPUs"* is the order by clause (sorting).

Entity Types
------------

An entity type represents the type of object that we want to search for. This is the base for the results that will come back, and is the starting point for the filter. In the above example, VMs is the entity type on which the results are based on. Then it goes on and filters the results based on a property (*ip address*) that is attached to that base entity.

The entity type can be in singular and plural form; VM or VMs. The entity type is the only mandatory property in a search query. The projection, filter, group by and order by clauses are optional.

Some common entity types are:

-   VM (Virtual Machine)

-   Host (ESXi Host and other Hosts)

-   Datastore

-   Vxlan / Vlan

-   Pnics (Physical nics)

-   Vnics (VM nics)

-   VRF (Logical Routers)

-   Route

-   Application

-   Flow

A full list of entity types can be found inside Network Insight. Simply search for 'help' or click the link "Learn more about supported properties" that is placed on the bottom of each search (see Figure 74).

![](./media/image78.tiff){width="2.962962598425197in" height="1.2386964129483815in"}

[]{#_Ref22480916 .anchor}Figure 74 -- Search help: find all supported properties

To give you a few more examples of how to spot what the entity type is, the table below lists a few.

  Search query                                             Entity Type
  -------------------------------------------------------- ------------------
  Router Interface where IP Address like '192.168.10.\*'   Router Interface
  Application where Problem = \'Threshold Event\'          Application
  Datastore where Free Space Percent \< 10%                Datastore
  Flows where Source Application = CRM                     Flows
  Network Rate of Switch Ports order by Network Rate       Switch Ports

[]{#_Toc35170260 .anchor}Table 4 -- Search examples, mapping out entity types

**Note**: The last example will become more clear when we go through the [Property]{.underline} explanation.

Meta Entity Types
-----------------

The meta entity type can refer to multiple concrete types. For example, VM refers to VMware VM, Azure VM, and AWS EC2 Instance. The same goes for Firewall Rule, which will include NSX Firewall Rules, AWS Firewall Rules, Palo Alto firewall rules, basically any firewall rules that Network Insight discovers. When searching for a meta entity type, the interface will show all included entity types. This allows you to filter on the exact firewall rules types you're searching for.

![](./media/image79.png){width="2.1296292650918636in" height="1.863426290463692in"}

[]{#_Toc35170233 .anchor}Figure 75 -- Search for a meta entity type and get all included entity types

Meta types exist to make the experience holistic, transparent to you. Considering the vast amount of different configurations and entity types an infrastructure engineer deals with, it's almost necessary to allow you to search for firewall rule and let the underlaying tool figure out on which actual platform (whether it be NSX, a physical firewall, or the cloud (and then which cloud)) you need to be.

Entity Property
---------------

Properties on entities are the details you're typically interested in. These properties can be grouped into the following categories:

### Configuration Property

Configuration properties of entity is something that typically does not change that often. It would need an interaction on the infrastructure in order to change.

For example, CPU Count, Memory, OS, in VMs. Or, Destination Port, Protocol, Source IP, in Flows. These properties tend not to change a lot.

### Reference Property

These are rather interesting. Objects inside Network Insight get correlated to other objects that relate to it, and these related objects get linked to the object in question. To make that a little less vague; an VM is directly related to the host it lives on, the datastore where it stores its data, the network and portgroup that it is connected to, etc.

These reference properties will appear as a link when looking at an object. On the VM dashboard, or when looking at VM search results, you will notice that you can click on a bunch of properties and get taken to their dashboard. Those are reference properties.

You can also use these reference properties in searches, but more on that in [Reference Traversal Queries]{.underline}.

### Metric Property

Metrics are properties that do change a lot and have a timeseries attached to it. Examples for VMs are CPU Usage, Packet Drop Rate, Write Latency.

To get an idea of what metric properties are available for an entity type, head to its dashboard and look at the Metrics heading. Figure 76 gives an example for the metric properties on a switch port.

![](./media/image80.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="2.2180555555555554in"}

[]{#_Ref22484064 .anchor}Figure 76 -- Search Metric Properties: example on switch port

### Meta Property

Remember the [Meta Entity Types]{.underline}? Meta properties are the same thing, only attached to another entity. This is a group of properties that's consolidated under a single property.

For example, the Flow entity has a meta property called VM. This refers to both Source VM and Destination VM. Here's an example:

Flow where VM = 'my-vm'

Above search is equivalent to:

Flow where Source VM = 'my-vm' or Destination VM = 'my-vm'

Similarly: Flow where IP Address = '192.168.10.0/24'

is equivalent to:

Flow where Source IP Address = '192.168.10.0/24' or Destination IP Address = '192.168.10.0/24'

These meta properties make it easier to execute searches and optimize the amount of typing you have to do.

Filter
------

A filter clause is used to filter search results. The condition in a filter clause consists of an entity property, comparison operator, and value. This is also where all previous discussed properties can be used to narrow down the results.

Here's an example: VMs where CPU Usage \> 80%

In this search query, VMs is the entity type and the filter is based on the metric property for CPU Usage. Using the comparison operator (**\>**) and value, the returned VM list is filtered on VMs that have a CPU Usage higher than 80%.

There's a lot possible with the filter conditions and comparison operators. Here is a graphical overview of the syntax:

![](./media/image81.jpeg){width="4.25in" height="4.902777777777778in"}

[]{#_Toc35170235 .anchor}Figure 77 -- Search filters; condition and comparison operators

It is possible to use multiple filter conditions in a single search and you can mix and match however you would like. To get a little more feeling with how these operators work and for examples on how they work, see the table below.

  Operator     Description                          Example
  ------------ ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  AND          Multiple conditions need to be met   VM where Account = \'AWS\_xx\' and AWS VPC = 'My-VPC'
  OR           Single condition should be met       Flow where Port = 80 OR Port = 443
  LIKE         Wildcard search                      VM where name LIKE 'web'
  =            Exact search                         VM where name = 'web01'
  !=           Anything but                         VM where name != 'web01'
  \<           Lower than                           Datastore where Free Space Percent \< 10%
  \<=          Lower than or equal to               VMs where CPU Count \<= 2
  \>           Higher than                          VMs where CPU Usage \> 80%
  \>=          Higher than or equal to              VMs where Memory \>= 8GB
  IN()         Values in this list                  Flows where Port IN(80, 443)
  NOT IN()     Values not in this list              Datastore where Filesystem Type NOT IN(\'NFS\', \'VSAN\')
  IS SET       Value has to be set                  Flow where Firewall Rule IS SET
  IS NOT SET   Value has not to be set              VM where Security Group IS NOT SET

[]{#_Toc35170261 .anchor}Table 5 -- Search filter condition examples

Projections
-----------

A projection clause in a search query decides what fields must be displayed from the filtered entities. By default, the search results will list commonly used properties of an object. For example, if you search for VMs, the results list will show the VM name, network it's attached to, disk information, and IP address. You can then either expand the result or go to the VM dashboard to get the rest of property information (such as CPU, memory, power state, etc.).

Using the projection clause, you can bring up a specific property directly in the results. Projections are an optional clause. If the projection clause is not specified, then the default set of properties are shown for entities in the results. Projection clause may contain one or more of following items:

a)  Property

b)  Count

c)  List

d)  Aggregation

e)  Series

### Property

If you search for an entity default set of properties are shown in the search results. If you want to see other properties (including metric properties), you can use property projection. For example, consider the following search query:

OS, CPU Cores of VMs where Name = myvm

The above search query will show the operating system and the number of CPU Cores of the VM named 'myvm', as shown below:

![](./media/image82.png){width="6.23373031496063in" height="2.268893263342082in"}

[]{#_Toc35170236 .anchor}Figure 78 -- Searching with property projection

As you can see, the requested properties are now shown first, in a highlighted fashion.

A projection clause can also include metric properties, combined with configuration properties. This will automatically show a line graph with the requested metric on the results page. If no time window is provided, the metrics will be shown for the last 24 hours.

Here's an example:

CPU Cores, CPU Usage Rate of VMs where Name = myvm

![](./media/image83.png){width="5.628435039370078in" height="2.323530183727034in"}

[]{#_Toc35170237 .anchor}Figure 79 -- Searching with property projection, including metrics

The above example can be done on any object, whether it be a VM, flow, datastore, switch port, etc. You can also add multiple metrics to the search query, making multiple line graphs appear in the results. A good use case for that, would be to search for network rate and packet loss on switch ports.

Using the Network Insight search engine is by far the quickest way to get specific information from your environment, dependent on that you know what you are looking for. This can be a specific object (troubleshooting a switch or VM), or specific metrics.

### Count

Mostly used when building pinboards, the Count projection can return the sum the number of objects in a search query result. It can be used to count the number of VMs inside a cluster, network flows coming from a specific region, ports or source IP range, number of datastores that have a write latency higher than 5 milliseconds, the list goes on.

Here are a few examples:

count of VMs where Security Group = \'sg-1\' and CPU Usage Rate \> 60%

count of Flows where Source IP = 10.152.30.208/24.

count of Switch Port where Total Packet Drops \> 100

count of Datastore where Write Latency \> 5ms

![](./media/image84.png){width="5.708333333333333in" height="1.7361111111111112in"}

[]{#_Toc35170238 .anchor}Figure 80 -- Searching with a count operator

Considering the result will be a number, these search queries are perfect to put on an auto refreshing pinboard that is glued to the wall of your office.

### List

This is another interesting one. The list operator should be used whenever the filter condition cannot be applied or if it is related to the object you want back. To make that a little more concrete, here's an example:

list(Host) of VMs where CPU Usage Rate \> 95%

![](./media/image85.png){width="5.934722222222222in" height="2.082352362204724in"}

[]{#_Toc35170239 .anchor}Figure 81 -- Searching with a list operator

In this case, a list of Hypervisors is returned that host any VM that has a higher CPU usage of 95%.

The object inside the list operator needs to be directly associated with the object in the filter, and not indirectly associated. Meaning you can get a list of Hosts from VMs, Datastores from Hosts (and VMs), Switch Ports from Hosts, etc. However, you cannot get a list of Switch Ports from VMs, as the direct association of Switch Ports will be with Hosts.

Alternatively, you can use reference queries, which can go deeper (and do indirect associations), but also have more overhead. More on that in the chapter [Reference Traversal Queries]{.underline}.

### Aggregate Functions

Just as the Count operator, an aggregate function allows you to calculate a single value from multiple sources. This retrieves *numerical* or *metric* properties and execute a calculation on them. The outcome of that calculation will be the search result.

I'll go into the supported aggregate functions below.

#### Max

Get the highest value out of the search results. Consider the search will return vCPU numbers for your VMs, the max operator will be able to tell you what the highest number of vCPUs is.

Example: max(vCPUs) of VMs

![](./media/image86.png){width="1.8136778215223097in" height="1.821428258967629in"}

[]{#_Toc35170240 .anchor}Figure 82 -- Searching with a max operator

The above result indicates that out of 789 VMs, the highest number of vCPUs that those VMs have, is 16 vCPUs.

#### Sum

Sometimes humans keep it simple and straightforward. These aggregate functions are an example of this. The sum operation, well, returns the sum of the requested values. You can use this to get the number of VMs attached to a VLAN, the amount of memory in use by VMs on a specific host, the amount of traffic going towards the internet (or certain geographical regions), etc. The possibilities seem to be only limited by imagination.

Example: sum(Bytes) of Flow where Source Continent = 'Europe'

![](./media/image87.png){width="3.72543416447944in" height="2.0119050743657043in"}

[]{#_Toc35170241 .anchor}Figure 83 -- Searching with a sum operator

#### Min

The min operator is effectively the same as the max operation; it just gets the minimum value of the search results. Ever wondered which switch has the lowest number of switch ports in use? Ever wondered which blade chassis has the least blades in use? The min operator can help.

#### Avg

Lastly, the avg operator can be used to get an average value from the search results. Just like the previously discussed operators, Network Insight will go through the results of the search query and return the average of those results. What is the average count of vCPUs or vMemory for VMs on a cluster, what is the average transfer bytes for a flow in your VDI cluster, compared to the production server cluster, etc.

Here's an example: avg(vCPUs) of VMs group by Host order by avg(vCPUs)

![](./media/image88.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="2.5458333333333334in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK9 .anchor}Figure 84 -- Searching with an avg operator

The above example returns the average count of vCPUs of VMs on each host.

Before I forgot; all aggregation operators can also be used in the **group by** clause, as you can see in the above example. When these operators are combined with the **group by** clause, there's an opportunity to **order by** something. More on ordering search results later on but know that the aggregation operators are included.

### Series

This is one of the coolest projection functions, by far. Network Insight can show line graphs for any metric that it collects. From network bandwidth usage, to CPU usage, to memory usage, you name it. The one thing that the out of the box metrics have in common, is that those line graphs will show only one metric type for a single object in the same graph.

Meaning, there will be different line graphs for the CPU, memory, and network usage on the VM dashboard. There will also be a different line graph for the network usage per each VM. That is where the series projection comes in.

It can combine metrics from multiple objects into a single line graph. For example; it can combine all network flows coming from VMs in the same cluster, or all network flows going towards the internet, of all CPU usageof all VMs in a specific cluster, etc.

Here's an example, combining all internet traffic into a single line graph:

series(sum(Byte Rate)) of Flows where Flow Type = \'Destination is Internet\'

![](./media/image89.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="1.0972222222222223in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK15 .anchor}Figure 85 -- Search; using the series() projection to combine metrics

The metrics inside the series projection can be any of the metrics available in Network Insight. You can also request multiple series in the same search, to compare different metrics on the same time line. An example of this, might be looking for the averaged used CPU and Memory metrics for all servers with 'db' in their name:

series(avg(CPU Usage)), series(avg(Memory Usage)) of VMs where Name like db

![](./media/image90.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="1.9854166666666666in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK11 .anchor}Figure 86 -- Search; using multiple series() projections to combine metrics

Ordering
--------

All search results can be sorted by using the **order by** clause. This clause takes one parameter, and results can be ordered descending or ascending (the default is descending).

Ordering becomes handy when you are looking for objects that are using the most resources. A few examples below.

Looking for the workloads that send the most network traffic? Order by Bytes

Looking for the VMs with the most vCPUs? Order by CPU Count

Looking for the VMs that use the least memory? Order by Memory Usage asc

The web interface can also be used to define the **order by** clause, by using the Sort selection

Grouping
--------

When you're using the search engine to identify trends, you typically want to group objects together, to get the right data. For example, you can group network flows by Country, list the number of VMs inside Security Groups, list the amount of bandwidth used by network ports, list the number of VMs on different operating systems (find the 2 VMs that are still running Windows 2003), the list goes on.

The **group by** operator can be used to group entities together, when they are grouped by a property. When using this operator, the group name and the number of entities found, will be shown.

Here's an example that list the number of VMs in each security group:

VMs group by Security Group

![](./media/image91.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="1.8173611111111112in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK17 .anchor}Figure 87 -- Search; using the group by operator

It gets more interesting when you start combining grouping with the previously explained Aggregate Functions. By combining these two, you are able to retrieve the sum, maximum, minimum, or average of a property while grouping it on another property. Let's look at a few examples below.

Retrieving the amount of bandwidth that comes out of each L2 network:

sum(Bytes) of Flows group by Source L2 Network

![](./media/image92.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="1.582638888888889in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK21 .anchor}Figure 88 -- Search; using the group by operator and aggregate functions for L2 traffic

Retrieving the number of incoming firewall rules inside your AWS accounts, grouping by VPC. This will display the number of rules, and the number of security groups inside each AWS VPC:

sum(Incoming Rule Count) of AWS Security Group group by AWS VPC

![](./media/image93.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.1743055555555557in"}

[]{#OLE_LINK35 .anchor}Figure 89 -- Search; using the group by operator and aggregate functions for AWS rules

Limiting
--------

When you order a search, sometimes you're only interested in the top 10 flows. Or the top 5 VMs that are using the most storage, CPU, or memory. To limit the search results by a specific number of results, simply add the **limit** operator. For example:

VMs order by CPU Cores limit 5

Flows where Flow Type = \'Destination is Internet\' order by Bytes limit 10

Reference Traversal Queries
---------------------------

Let's say you want to filter the search results based on a property that is not directly attached to the entity you're searching for. An example of this would be to filter on the CPU usage of the Host, while searching for VMs. In this case, reference traversal queries can be used to do refer to the property that you want to filter on.

To refer to the properties of a referenced object use a DOT(.) operator with the primary property. Behind the 'parent' property, the child properties can be used normally. Think of this traversal as going a folder deeper into the entities.

Let's look at a few examples, in order to give you a better understanding of how this looks.

Find all VMs on hosts with a high CPU utilization:

VMs where Host.CPU Usage Rate \> 95%

Find all VMs on a specific compute blade:

VMs where Host.Blade = \'\[ucs-1.vrni.cmbu.local\]-\[sys/chassis-1/blade-7\]\'

Find all VMs that are located on a cluster that does not have the NSX Distributed Firewall enabled:

VMs where Cluster.Firewall Feature Enabled = false

Take note of the DOT (.) in between the entity (Host or Cluster) that is directly attached to the entity that is being searched on (VM) and the property that is being filtered on. Because Network Insight only correlates and stores properties that are directly related to a specific entity, the VM entity does not have the CPU Usage Rate of the Host that it is on. The Host can change with a vMotion, so it doesn't make sense to directly relate to the Host CPU usage. However, using these reference traversal queries, you can still filter based on the properties of the Host (or Cluster, or anything else that comes up in the VM filters).

  ------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INFO   Reference Traversal Queries are heavy on the database. Just like joined queries in relational databases, these queries will cause Network Insight to traverse through multiple database tables and compare records. Try to avoid using them often, and don't be surprised if they take a few seconds.
  ------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nested Queries
--------------

As an alternative to reference traversal queries, nested queries are also possible. The results of a nested query can be used to filter in the original query. Nested queries will be executed first, meaning you'll have the results available in order to filter on the main query. While this is similar to reference traversal queries, it's written in a different way.

To make this tangible, let's have a look at the examples of the previous chapter, only in nested query form:

Find all VMs on hosts with a high CPU utilization:

VMs where Host in (Host where CPU Usage Rate \> 95%)

Find all VMs on a specific compute blade:

VMs where Host in (Host where Blade = \'\[ucs-1.vrni.cmbu.local\]-\[sys/chassis-1/blade-7\]\')

Find all VMs that are located on a cluster that does not have the NSX Distributed Firewall enabled:

VMs where Cluster in (Cluster where Firewall Feature Enabled = false)

As you can see, it's a bit more text -- but to me, this is more readable.

Time Control
------------

You can use the time control to change the time point of the results. By default, searches involving configuration will return the last known configuration ('now'), and metrics will be returned for the last 24 hours.

For example, bytes of flows will show traffic for flows over a period of 24 hours, and firewall rules will return the firewall rules that currently exist. Time control can be used to return configuration properties at a specific point in time, or to modify the time span of returned metrics.

This can be done from the time indicator that is on the right of the search query, inside the web interface. It can also be done from inside the search query itself.

![](./media/image94.png){width="2.448869203849519in" height="3.4523807961504813in"} ![](./media/image95.png){width="2.9785247156605426in" height="3.4523807961504813in"}

[]{#_Ref24291822 .anchor}Figure 90 -- Search; time control in the web interface

As shown in [Figure 90]{.underline} above, it's easy to jump from the current time to some most used points, such as **Yesterday**, **Last 3 Days**, etc. You can also use the **At** option to jump to a very specific time, used for getting to know the exact configuration at that time. Then there's the **Between** option, where you can specific a time range; mostly used for metrics to show graphs of a specific time period.

You can also specify the time control inside a search query, by using the following syntax:

*search query* in last X (minutes\|hours\|days\|weeks\|months)

Here's an example: Flow in last 48 hours or something like: changes in last 3 hours

The above example uses searches that return results (metrics or change events) in a time range. You can do something similar to search for configuration of a specific time in point, like this:

Firewall Rules at November 5 14:00

The above example will return all firewall rules that existed on November 5^th^ at 14:00 (sorry, it does not take pm/am times, have to provide the 24-hours format. ;-) ).

When you start combining configuration and metric results, while using time control; it will pick the highest value of time. For some examples, see below.

VMs where CPU Usage \> 80%

The result of the above query will be all the VMs that have had a CPU usage higher than 80% in the last 24 hours.

VMs where CPU Count = 4

The result of the above query will show all VMs that currently have a CPU count of 4.

VMs where CPU Count = 4 and CPU Usage \> 80%

The result of the above query will be all the VMs that have had CPU usage higher than 80% and where the CPU count 4 in last 24 hours.

Automating Network Insight
==========================

We've now come to a topic that's very close to my heart: automation. Because deep, deep, deep down I'm really lazy. But mostly because I don't like having to do repetitive tasks.

Automation helps you be more efficient; it gets things done faster and does each time exactly the same. This mostly helps in bringing the control closer to the users of your products and services and freeing up the IT staff to do better things than just provisioning virtual machines and installing applications manually. Like architecting the infrastructure to become more resilient, explore new technologies to push your infrastructure further. You know, doing more fun stuff.

In the data center world, we're usually talking about deploying application stacks using virtual machines with all kinds of configurations including storage, networking & compute options via an automation and orchestration layer.

Now I hear you wondering, "What does that have to do with a troubleshooting & monitoring tool?". Well, a lot!

Pushing Data In
---------------

There are a few reasons to push data into Network Insight. They all have to do with providing more context or pushing in configuration data. Let's start with the context reason first.

As you've learned in the chapter **Application Security Planning**, application context can be discovered from metadata straight from the infrastructures' inventory, or it can be created manually (or via the API). While application discovery works like a charm, it is also good to eliminate the (manual) discovery step by pushing the application construct into Network Insight directly from the infrastructure automation system that is provisioning the application onto the infrastructure. That way, you've got instant context for any newly deployed application.

The other reason to push data into Network Insight is to keep configuration synchronized. Data sources is a good example of this configuration. If you have a lot of physical switches, routers or firewalls deployed in the infrastructure and new ones are added regularly, you could automate the creation of those devices in Network Insight when they are added to the network. That way, they will be instantly monitored and available for troubleshooting exercises, without having to add them manually.

Pulling Data Out
----------------

At the other end of the spectrum, pulling data out of Network Insight for other systems is another reason to start automating. It is a treasure trove of information and other systems you might have put in place could benefit from it.

One widely used example is to take the network traffic flows for very specific virtual machines (the "highly confidential" or "at risk" ones) and forward the details of those flows to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to correlate those flows to other events that application or other systems generate. Because Network Insight is context rich, you can be very specific with which flows you export. In one of the real-world examples I'll get to later (Exporting Network Flows for Security Analytics), it is as simple as setting a simple tag on a virtual machine for it to be included in the broader security scrutiny.

Another example is to take virtual machine information and export it into a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) and make sure the virtual machine details are always in sync with the actual environment.

If that's not of interest, how about generating a daily report of all the configuration changes that happened in your environment? Every changed firewall rule, every created or deleted virtual machine, virtual machine hardware upgrades, any changes that created a problem inside the infrastructure, you name it.

I could go on with examples but seeing the range of things you can do should spark some ideas. Take any bit of information Network Insight has and combine it with your own systems; endless possibilities.

Automation makes it all possible.

API
---

Now that we've covered why you would want to automate Network Insight, let's take a look at how. Network Insight has a private and public REST API hosted on the Platform appliance.

Taking one step back, a REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. This has become an industry standard in the last few years, simply because it's so dead simple. You do extremely advanced automation with REST APIs but in the basics, it's just HTTP calls and you can use any HTTP client (like a browser or cURL) to call on these APIs. When testing with APIs, I recommend you use the [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) client, which is perfect for API development.

Inside REST, there's a reference architecture that lets you do HTTP calls in different ways that have different effects. If that sounds fuzzy, here's a technical explanation:

HTTP has several different methods, like GET to retrieve information, POST to deliver information (the content should be put in the body of the request), PUT to modify information and DELETE to remove information. These methods translate to the action you want to take in the API. If you do a GET request, you'll get information back from the API. If you do a DELETE request, the API knows that you want to delete an object.

When receiving the response from the API, there are a few aspects to take into account. The response HTTP status code (200, 400, etc.) will indicate whether the API call was a success (200), or if the request was formatted incorrectly (400), or if you don't have an authorized session (401), or if the API broke something (500). There are other codes, but these will be the most relevant. If you requested content (GET), the returning body will contain the requested information.

Officially (as not all APIs adhere to this), REST APIs should use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as the format in which the data is transferred between client and server. This is also an industry standard, which has the benefit that about every programming or scripting language knows how to read JSON and present it back to you in a usable form. It also helps that it's human readable.

This book isn't about teaching you about these standards and technologies and for the rest of this chapter, I'm going to assume you have a basic grasp of REST calls and JSON. I'm also not going through all API calls and functionalities but will give you enough information to get started. Complement this chapter by reading the vRealize Network Insight API Guide.

  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INFO   Currently, Network Insight rate limits the amount of API calls per second to 20. When doing API calls, rate limit your own script to not overload the API. You will be throttled, and the API will start giving out error code **429**.
  ------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### API Explorer

As with many of the VMware products these days, Network Insight has an API Explorer built in to the interface. This API Explorer holds the reference documentation for each API call that's available. If you're looking for parameters to include into the API call, this is the place. It also has a very handy feature where you can try out the API call directly from the interface to help in the process of formatting the right structure for a successful API call.

It can be found under the gear icon on the top right; API Documentation. There will be 2 tabs: API Reference and Documentation. The reference tab lists all API calls and their format and parameters (you'll use this one the most) and the documentation tab contains links to the API Guide and OpenAPI specification.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#_Toc35170249 .anchor}Figure 91 -- Built in API Explorer

### Swagger / OpenAPI Specification

An [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) (previously known as Swagger) specification is a description format for an API which can describe the contents of an API. Each endpoint, input and output parameters, authentication methods and other details around the API. This specification is what the developers use to describe all API endpoints and it is used to generate the documentation you see in the API Explorer.

It can also be used to automatically generate code for client libraries, or otherwise known as software development kits (SDK). While Network Insight does not have those SDKs yet, I'm holding out hope for future availability.

The OpenAPI specification is a very good reference source when you're building automation that consumes the custom objects that the API provides. For instance, when retrieving information about entities (VMs, IP Sets, Hosts, all objects from your infrastructure), there will be an **entity\_type** field inside the returned object data. This **entity\_type** describes the schema of data that will be included in the result. By looking up the entity type inside the OpenAPI specification, you know what schema you can expect to be able to use.

For example, here's a snippet of the "VirtualMachine" entity type:

These definitions can be nested, which the field **allOf** is referencing too. The **VirtualMachine** entity inherits everything from **BaseVirtualMachine**. Then we have the fields that are specific to a VM, like **cpu\_count** and **memory**, but also references to other entities.

If you look at the **cluster** field, it has **Reference** as value. This means that the result will contain references to other entity IDs which you can request separately. In this case, the entity ID that will be returned in the cluster field will be the vSphere DRS Cluster and you can retrieve the details about that DRS cluster by referencing that ID.

### Authentication

Before you can do any other API calls, you need to authorize your session and get an authentication token. This token will be used throughout any subsequent API calls that you want to execute.

To get an authentication token, use the **/auth/token** API endpoint. This is the only place where you'll need to specify a username and password; all the other endpoints rely on the authentication token for proper authorization.

As we're sending data (the credentials) across, the /auth/token endpoint takes a POST request. Formatting the POST body is fairly straight forward using JSON:

This example uses a credentials that is tied to a LDAP directory with the domain name **example.com**. If you were to use credentials that are local to the Network Insight platform, you would use something like this:

If the call is successful (right credentials, formatted correctly and the API or backend isn't on fire), you will receive a HTTP code 200 back and the response body will look something like this:

An authorization token is valid for 5 hours after you've requested it. Usually API calls are done on demand, but if you're scheduling calls continuously; keep in mind to refresh the token at least every 5 hours. Otherwise it will expire, and your subsequent API calls will return a 401 (unauthorized). The **expiry** field is the exact time that the token will expire. It is really exact, as it is formatted as an epoch timestamp in milliseconds (epoch usually stands for the seconds from January 1^st^, 1970 at 00:00:00 GMT). You can use this timestamp to see if your token is due for a refresher.

Then there's the **token** field. This base64 encoded string is to be used in any following API calls in the HTTP headers, like so:

Save the authentication token to a variable that you can reuse inside the script or workflow that you are building.

**Network Insight as a Service Authentication**

As you may remember from the chapter []{.underline}

[Hosted Architecture (SaaS]{.underline}), there is a difference in authentication between the on-premises Network Insight and the one that's delivered as SaaS. There is a single-sign-on platform in place for all VMware Cloud Services (CSP) products, meaning there is no user management within Network Insight, and you'll need to go through CSP to get an authentication token to use in the Network Insight API calls.

CSP works with so-called refresh tokens as a way of authentication. When using the API, you need to exchange a refresh token for an authentication token and use that when talking to the Network Insight API (or any other Cloud Service).

Refresh tokens are linked to an CSP account. To create one, log into <https://cloud.vmware.com> and go to your Console. Then open up your personalized menu (top right) and click **My Account**. Select the **API Tokens** tab and click **Generate a new API token** to get a refresh token. It'll look something like this: **ax22ea9i-139b-344x-lif7-ex6856ce57fa**

These refresh tokens are valid for 6 months, which you need to keep in mind when building automation based on these tokens.

After getting a refresh token, there's a single CSP API call you need to call to exchange a refresh token for an authentication token:

<https://console.cloud.vmware.com/csp/gateway/am/api/swagger-ui.html#/Authentication/getAccessTokenByApiRefreshTokenUsingPOST>

Executing this API call successfully, will give you a result like this:

The **access\_token** is the important field here, which you need to save and consider as the authentication token for the Network Insight API calls. There is, however, a slight difference in how you send this token across to the API. Instead of sending the **Authorization** header in your API call, you'll need to insert a header called **csp-auth-token** with the value of the authentication token that you've retrieved from the CSP API. Like so:

As a final note, it is also worth noting that the URL for the Network Insight as-a-Service API is the same for all environments: <https://api.mgmt.cloud.vmware.com/ni/$api-endpoint>

Once you're authenticated, return to the API Explorer and find the API call that you need to retrieve or push the information you want.

### A Few Examples

When using the API, you most likely have a fixed goal and know what you need to do in order to get there. The API Explorer will be your best friend for getting examples. Below are a few examples which are to illustrate how to work with the API in a broad sense. There are some gotchas you need to take into account.

#### Retrieving a list of VMs

Using Network Insight to get a list of VMs might be useful if you have a large environment with multiple vCenters. Network Insight aggregates all data in one place, so you'd only have to do a single API call to get every VM.

First, we need to find the right API call to get this list. Turn to the API Explorer and you will find a call to the endpoint **/entities/vms**. This has the description "List vms", so it's probably the one we're looking for. If you then look at the available parameters, this is what shows:

![](./media/image98.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="1.1784722222222221in"}

[]{#_Toc35170250 .anchor}Figure 92 -- Parameters for API endpoint /entities/vms

For all the Entity endpoints, you'll see that the parameters are pretty much the same. There is a **size** parameter for the amount of results returned on a page, a **cursor** parameter to indicate from which page you want to start getting results and a **start\_time** and **end\_time**, which can be used to go back in time. Remember that there is a timeline to show historical data? Using **start\_time** and **end\_time** can get the list of VMs that existed a week ago, including the ones that have been deleted since.

The **cursor** is important to get full results. By default, the results for returned entities are paged in pages of the indicated **size** (default 10 results) and with every returned page, there'll also be a next **cursor** value in there, which you can use to request the next page. Have a look at this example:

![](./media/image99.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.3222222222222224in"}

[]{#_Toc35170251 .anchor}Figure 93 -- Using Postman to execute API endpoint /entities/vms

In this example, I'm using Postman to get a list of VMs, limited by 2 results. The first thing you'll notice is that there are actually any VM attributes listed in the results, just **entity\_id**s. This works the same with all entities; it returns a list of references to entities. You can take the **entity\_id** and get detailed information by using the specific entity type API endpoint. In the case of the first result this will be **/entities/vms/17603:1:1010454414**, but we'll get to that.

Inside the result, the "results" array contains the resulting entities (thanks, captain obvious!). I'd like to get your attention to the other results. As said, there's a **cursor** value that indicates the next page, a **total\_count** with the amount of total results available (regardless the page limit) and the timeline values. The timeline is by default set to the current time, if you do not give a timeline yourself.

We've got 2 results now and there are 109 in total, which makes this next API call:

The result will be the next 2 VMs in the list and another cursor value. Continue on like this until you've got all 109 VMs returned. Do this inside a loop and dynamically look for the **total\_count** and the current count of results in order to determine to do another API call or be satisfied with the results. You could also look out for the **cursor** value. If there's no more pages, this cursor value will be empty.

#### Creating an Application

Now you know how to retrieve information, let's take a look at creating something via the API. Of all API calls that push data towards Network Insight, creating applications is the most used one as it can be used on an ongoing basis. Applications are the most dynamic factor in most environments, usually in a way that there are new applications being spun up all the time.

If you want to get the right context for troubleshooting and monitoring, you need to populate those new applications inside Network Insight. Couple this process closely to your application deployment automation and use the Network Insight API to provision applications while the application is being deployed. Automagically.

There are two steps required to create an application container:

1)  Create the application itself

2)  Create a tier within the newly created application with a filter that points to workloads (using tags, VM names, folders, any logical object in the virtualization layer).

In the API Explorer, there's an entire section devoted to application management. You'll quickly find the endpoints **/groups/applications** (POST) and **/groups/applications/{id}/tiers** (POST), which are needed to create an application.

Creating an application via /groups/application (POST) doesn't require much; just an application name. The result will contain the **entity\_id** that it has given the new application. Store that for the next call. Here's an example using the name **My-New-Application**. The top text area is the body that is being sent to the API and the bottom text area is the result that the API returns:

![](./media/image100.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.3243055555555556in"}

[]{#_Toc35170252 .anchor}Figure 94 -- Using Postman to create an application via the API

You now have an empty application without any tiers. Let's add some!

Here's where the previously saved **entity\_id** comes in handy, as the API endpoint looks like this: **/groups/applications/17603:561:840848559/tiers**

The body of this endpoint is a bit more elaborate though, as it needs not only a name but also a filter to determine which workloads will be added to this tier. The filter is basically a search query, so you can filter on any logical object (tags, VM names, folders, etc.) to get the right VMs in the tier. In this example, I'll use a simple search based on VM name. Here's the formatted API call:

![](./media/image101.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.3243055555555556in"}

[]{#_Toc35170253 .anchor}Figure 95 -- Using Postman to create an application tier via the API

As you can see, there is a **name** field (which is the name the new tier is given) in the body and an array called **group\_membership\_criteria**. This is where you define the search query that looks for workloads to put into the tier.

I've used an **entity\_type** called **BaseVirtualMachine** and a filter that looks for the names **VM01** and **VM02**. The filter can be formatted using the search query logic (throwback to chapter []{.underline}

[\
Using the Search]{.underline} Engine) and the you can find the **entity\_type** options in the OpenAPI specification under the \"definitions\" structure (examples are: Cluster, SecurityTag, EC2SecurityGroup, etc., etc.).

The result of creating the application tier is the tier definition echoed back plus the newly assigned **entity\_id** along with a reference to the parent application.

You now have a new application with a single tier with 2 VMs in it. If you need multiple tiers, rinse and repeat the second call.

Using PowerShell (PowervRNI)
----------------------------

Moving on from using raw APIs, there are tools available to get you faster up and running. When you're integrating with an existing automation or orchestration platform, you might need to use the API directly, but if you just want to execute a simple script to speed up a task; abstraction tools are the way to go. With these, you can simply fire a command and it handles the API endpoint calls for you. Just focus on the bare minimum input and get on with the results.

In this chapter I'm going to walk you through using PowerShell to talk to the Network Insight API.

### Why PowerShell?

This is a question I get a lot. There are a lot of scripting frameworks available and there are usually two camps: Linux based and Windows based tools. This is mostly because these scripting frameworks are built into the operating system itself.

People from the Linux world usually default to scripting languages like python, ruby, or even perl. Because these are (usually) installed by default on a Linux distribution.

People from the Windows world usually default to PowerShell. Again, because it's available by default on the newer versions of Windows.

But there's more. One of the reasons PowerShell is a popular scripting language to use, is because it uses a natural language design of its features. All functions that you can use, are named in a very natural way. If you want to get some information, the function will start with **Get-**. If you want to set an option or parameter, the function will start with **Set-**. If you want to invoke a command of some sort, the function will start with **Invoke-**.

PowerShell is also easily extendable with modules. Modules are basically just text files with custom functions that you can download and load or create yourself and publish. There is a central repository located on [powershellgallery.com](https://www.powershellgallery.com/), from which you can download modules manually and install them or simply install them directly from a PowerShell window with **Install-Module moduleName**. There are currently over 4.200 modules on the PowerShellGallery, so plenty to choose from.

It also helps that PowerShell was made a multi-platform tool for Windows, Linux and MacOS with version 6.0 in the beginning of 2018. I've been running it on MacOS ever since and haven't looked back at my Windows virtual machine. ;-)

If you would like to learn more around PowerShell, I highly recommend the [PowerShell: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/powershell-getting-started/table-of-contents) course by Michael Bender on Pluralsight.

### PowervRNI

Most of the VMware related PowerShell modules, official and community developed, start with the prefix **Power** to relate it to PowerShell. For example, we have [PowerNSX](https://github.com/vmware/powernsx), [PowerCLI](https://code.vmware.com/tool/vmware-powercli), [PowervRA](https://github.com/jakkulabs/PowervRA), and a couple others.

When Network Insight 3.6 with the first version of the public API came out in November 2017, the PowerShell module to make use of this API was already in the making, as it was highly requested amongst the companies I was working with. Adhering to the unofficial naming convention; the module was named [PowervRNI](https://github.com/PowervRNI/powervrni).

It currently has 44 functions and around 95% of API coverage.

My goal with PowervRNI was pretty straight forward: make it easy to get started with the Network Insight public API and make it easy to integrate with other systems. I'm proud to say that it has been used to solve a breath of use cases involving data sharing issues between multiple systems. From security use cases where extra data around network traffic flows and infrastructure info is sent to a SIEM system to better collation, to importing a large amount of data sources (usually physical network devices) into Network Insight during the initial set up, to integrations with CMDB systems to synchronize the CMDB inventory with the real-life situation. I will go into a few example use cases in the upcoming chapters, but up-to-date examples can be found [on my blog](http://lostdomain.org/tag/powervrni/).

#### Getting Started with PowervRNI

There are two ways to get PowervRNI on your system: a manual and automated way.

##### Installing Manually

Installing it manually can be a good option on systems where you don't have permissions to use the cmdlet **Install-Module**. Although the newer PowerShell versions have to ability to install modules just for yourself (parameter "*-Scope CurrentUser*"), it can still be locked down.

A manually install simply means downloading the module source files and placing them locally, where you can load them.

Get the module source files from here: <https://powervrni.github.io/>

And then open up a PowerShell window, change directory to where you have put the module source files and load PowervRNI like this:

##### Installing Automagically

Using the built-in cmdlet **Install-Module** will download the module source files for you and place them somewhere where PowerShell knows to load them. Open up a PowerShell window and execute these commands:

The first command is to make the PowerShellGallery a trusted source. You'll only have to do this once and it prevents showing a notice that asks you for permission to download from the PowerShellGallery because it's an untrusted repository. You can still install the module without adding it to the trusted repositories, but it's just cleaner this way.

After the installation has completed, load PowervRNI like this:

Notice that there's a slight difference in loading the PowervRNI module. When installing a module via **Install-Module**, you can load the modules from anywhere and you don't have to give the relative path to the module source files. That's why I recommend doing it via the automagical way, if you have the option.

##### Getting Familiar

Now that PowervRNI is on your system and loaded, take a little time to explore the available cmdlets to see what's available and which ones you would like to try. Get a complete list of available cmdlets by executing this:

Every cmdlet in PowervRNI is well-documented and has examples of its usage and you can get that documentation via PowerShell:

##### Connecting to Network Insight

In the previous chapters, you've learned about the way Network Insight handles authentication (via authorization tokens). PowervRNI uses the authorization tokens for all API calls, which means you need to connect and authorize first.

There are two cmdlets to connect a Network Insight instance. There's **Connect-vRNIServer** to connect to vRealize Network Insight (the on-prem variant) and there's **Connect-NIServer** to connect to the Network Insight as a Service variant.

**Connect-NIServer** is extremely simple to use and only required the Refresh Token that you have created in chapter [Authentication]{.underline}.

This exchanged the Refresh Token for an authentication token and that will be used for subsequent API calls and you are now free to use the rest of the cmdlets inside PowervRNI.

**Connect-vRNIServer** takes a few more parameters, as the on-premises instance would have more details like the IP or hostname of the Platform VM and the credentials to connect.

There are two ways to handle the credentials. You can input the username and password when you connect (either pass them as parameters or be prompted on them) or you can create a [PSCredential](https://blog.kloud.com.au/2016/04/21/using-saved-credentials-securely-in-powershell-scripts/) file once and refer to that file when connecting. This would be the preferred way to connect if you're running a scheduled task. Remember, plain text passwords make babies cry.

If the connection was a success, you will see the authentication token being returned which is stored and used for subsequent API calls.

Automation Use Cases
--------------------

Now that we've covered the **how** of automation with Network Insight in the previous chapters, let's focus on the **why**.

In the upcoming chapters, I'll give you 4 examples of use cases which might give some inspiration. These examples are not all there is, of course, the amount of value you can get out of automation are as vast as the data that's being collected by Network Insight. The following examples are real-life use cases that I've helped organizations to implement.

### Integrating with Infrastructure Automation & Orchestration systems

Beginning with the first of 2 application focused use cases, let's have a look at an integration between an infrastructure automation and/or orchestration system. In the context of this integration, an infrastructure automation system is used to deploy applications and all its dependencies. From the virtual machines with their compute, storage and network properties, to installing required software packages and configuring them. Full application deployment.

Why is that important? Well, remember that having the application context in Network Insight enriches your experience immensely. How great would it be to have the application context be created at the same time as the actual application is being deployed? That's where an integration to your automation system comes into play.

#### Example

vRealize Automation (vRA) is an infrastructure lifecycle management and automation platform, which can be compared to an octopus; it extends its reach to other systems to execute actions (like deploying a virtual machine) and can grow extra (custom) arms to systems that it does not out of the box talk to.

As an example, I'll be using a 3-tiered application blueprint that contains a web server, application server, and database server tier. Of the web and application tiers, there can be multiple VMs deployed but there's just one database server. They are linked to vSphere templates which will be cloned when a deployment is requested.

![http://lostdomain.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/vrni-vra-blueprint-tiers-1024x550.png](./media/image102.png){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.3618055555555557in"}

[]{#_Toc35170254 .anchor}Figure 96 -- Example vRealize Automation 3-tiered Application Blueprint

This blueprint design relates directly to an application construct within Network Insight, using the blueprint name as application name and the different types of machine deployments (Web, App, DB) as the names for the tiers. When this blueprint is deployed by someone, vRA will deploy the virtual machines, networks, storage and the software packages on the newly created virtual machines. After that work is done, we can insert a custom vRealize Orchestrator (vRO, the octopus' engine) workflow that will take this newly created application and creates the application context inside Network Insight.

Inside vRA, there's an Event Broker which you can use to kick off workflows during specific stages of a deployment. You can create a subscription on the event that signals that a deployment is done, and all virtual machines have been deployed. This subscription also indicates which vRO workflow should be started.

  ------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  INFO   The vRO workflow and a step by step guidance of how to install it, can be [found on my blog](http://lostdomain.org/2018/11/08/integrating-vrealize-automation-with-network-insight/). The actual code is not the point of this chapter; I'm giving you an example of how it can work with vRA, but this can be applied with any and all infrastructure automation & orchestration systems.
  ------ --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a graphical overview of how the process works, so you can translate it to your own system.

### Importing Applications from Configuration Management Databases

Application Discovery is important to get the right application context in Network Insight. While you can natively integrate the ServiceNow CMDB, there are ways to integrate other CMDBs using the API. If you are not using ServiceNow for your CMDB needs, don't fret. I think it's pretty safe to say that all relevant CMDB systems have a way to export data from its systems and most will even have an API to talk to.

If it has an API; good! You can set up a periodical synchronization between the CMDB and Network Insight. This workflow should retrieve a list of application names, optional tiers and all the virtual machines and/or physical IP addresses attached to that application. You then use that list and ask the Network Insight API if this application already exists and compare the virtual machines and physical IP addresses to see if anything has changed (and then update it). If the application doesn't exist; create it with the info from the CMDB.

Here's a visual representation of this workflow:

![](./media/image104.tiff){width="6.263888888888889in" height="3.1930555555555555in"}

[]{#_Toc35170256 .anchor}Figure 98 -- Import Applications from CMDB workflow

#### Example

Importing data from a CMDB can be easy when it has an API. iTop is an open source CMDB system which can track infrastructure inventory and changes to it. I use it to track my own inventory (yes, I need a system for that. Don't judge me. ;-)).

In the examples directory of PowervRNI, there is an example script that pulls out application items from iTop, traverses the relationship tree and discovers VMs that are attached to that application. Then it adds that application tree as an application construct into Network Insight.

As the script is just a bit too big to paste here, I'll leave you with a link to it:

### Exporting Network Flows for Security Analytics

Getting out of the application realm, let's focus on a security use case. As Network Insight gathers all network flows going through the network, it has visibility on what's actually happening with your applications. Is it behaving accordingly, sending and receiving traffic that it is supposed to? For instance, a web server should only send out connections that it needs to support its website (usually just HTTP\[S\]). If it starts sending out SSH traffic, it's probably compromised and is trying to compromise other systems.

While you can create user-defined events based on anomalies like that and have an alert sent out when that starts happening, it's usually more prevalent to send the network flow information to a SIEM system. That system would also be able to take the application generated logs and correlate them together for an end to end view.

Sending all network flows all the time might not be a preferable situation, as the amount of data can overwhelm the SIEM and it might not be interesting to record every network flow. Instead, what I've seen is more a reactive setup based on other events. The SIEM or other monitoring system catches something that seems off and sets a tag on a virtual machine, which in turn triggers the network flow import to SIEM.

Of course, you can customize this to your own requirements.

#### Example

Using PowervRNI, exporting flows and sending them to another system is fairly simple as there's a cmdlet needed to retrieve the network flows: **Get-vRNIFlow**. Here's an example:

Flow records have a bunch of correlated information attached, as you can see in the example above. I'd like to highlight a few fields on which you could filter, which would be beneficial when looking for specific flows:

  **Field**              **Description**
  ---------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **traffic\_type**      Which way is the traffic going? **INTERNET\_TRAFFIC** or **EAST\_WEST\_TRAFFIC** are possibilities.
  **source\_\***         Source of traffic; not only IP address, but also context like **vm**, **vnic**, **datacenter**, etc.
  **destination\_\***    Same as above, only for the destination (including context)
  **firewall\_action**   When integrated with VMware NSX Data Center, this can show flows which are blocked by the Distributed Firewall (DFW)

### Tenant Bandwidth Chargeback / Showback

Using the network flow data in Network Insight, you can also make money. I used to work for a provider which had a range of services, like leasing out physical data center room and network connectivity to or simple virtual machines. All services had something in common; we charged for bandwidth. This is fairly common in provider land and everyone has their way of metering, we had a custom application (that I created) that listened on a mirror (span) port and looked at the actual traffic of our tenants. It saved the byte size of the packets linked to a source IP and saved that number to a database. At the end of every month, we generated reports from this database in order to invoice the customers for the amount of bandwidth they used, that month.

While we had our issues, this was a pretty clean approach. Other service providers didn't have the option of creating their own program to do this and relied on multiple data sources to tell them the total bandwidth usage. I've heard many stories about losing revenue because they couldn't get the right data to invoice their customers.

This bandwidth data is available within Network Insight and there are ways to get a clean list of bandwidth usage per IP (source or destination) in several formats. Using the API is one of those formats. In the below example, I'll go through an extremely simple example on how to use the API and retrieve bandwidth usage per source IP address.

####  Example

There is an API endpoint called aggregation ([/api/ni/search/aggregation]{.underline}), which can be used to fetch sums or averages of a specified metric. In this case, we'll be using the aggregation endpoint to retrieve the sum of flows coming and going to a specific IP address. To understand what's going on in that script, here's the API call:

Inside this call, the aggregations field is where we specify the operation the aggregation needs to perform. In this case, it's a **SUM** operation on the field **flow.totalBytes.delta.summantion.bytes**. This translates to "SUM(Bytes) of Flow" in the regular UI search bar, as the API search uses the internal naming convention of objects.

Also take note of the filter, where the search condition is given. This can be a single condition as in the example above, but also multiple conditions. For example, if you don't care about splitting out download and upload and want a single number for all bandwidth combined, use:

You can modify the filter to use VMs or any other of the objects inside Network Insight. Get creative!

Lastly, the **start\_time** and **end\_time** fields indicate the time window that the result should be based on.

As a result of this API call, you will get a recap of the aggregation request and the value of the query:

The field **aggregations.value** is the number of bytes that matches the filter.

You can find the PowervRNI example script here: <https://github.com/PowervRNI/powervrni/blob/master/examples/get-bandwidth-usage-per-ip.ps1>

Automation Conclusion
---------------------

I hope the examples in the previous pages have been helpful to get your imagination going on what is possible when you start automating Network Insight. These examples have just scraped the surface of what's possible, and there's a whole integration ecosystem possible that takes advantage of the data.
