I hope you have learned from this book and can use these ramblings to use vRealize Network Insight better. You have picked up valuable tips and tricks to solve networking productions quicker than you used to.

Together we went through the use cases for Network Insight, how the product looks under the hood, how you can use it best, how to automate against it, and so much more. Practice makes perfect, so now that you have all the tools, go out there and use them.

I leave you with Fred, the unofficial official mascot of Network Insight. There's a whole story about how the Samurai could see all things happening on the battlefield, but honestly, he just looks cool. ;-)

Mostly appearing on stickers, Fred has had a few makeovers in the last few years.
